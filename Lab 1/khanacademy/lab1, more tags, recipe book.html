<p>This recipe could not be easier to make; you’ll be sipping on your healthy banana protein shake in no time. Simply place all your ingredients (once your bananas and Greek yogurt cubes are frozen) in your blender and blend until smooth.

  Serve this protein shake with your favorite toppings. We drizzled ours with drippy peanut butter, and added a dollop of whipped coconut milk to the top, which we’d highlyyy recommend. All you need to do is put a whole can of coconut milk in the freezer, and once it’s chilled, remove the can and scoop out JUST the solidified coconut milk at the top of the can. Whip until smooth and airy with your hand mixer. Feel free to add a dash of maple or honey to give this whip a little sweetness if you so choose. Dollop away!
